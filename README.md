# java-elixir
Conversing between java and elixir


# What this repo will achieve
Using http://erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/java/com/ericsson/otp/erlang/package-summary.html, it will demonstrate how to use java from elixir to handle a task that relies on a single thread performance (a use case where java would be preferable over elixir)

The other direction, java <-> elixir, it will show how to delegate a task to elixir that relies heavily on concurrency (a use case where elixir would be preferable over java)
